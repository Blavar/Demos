Here's a problem: 2.53 from "Introduction to Probability" by Blitzstein, Hwang:

"There are 100 equally spaced points around a circle, at 99 of the points, there are sheep, and at 1 point, there is a wolf.
At each time step, the wolf randomly moves wither clockwise or counterclockwise by 1 point. If there is a sheep at that point, he eats it.
The sheep don't move. What is the probability that the sheep who is initially opposite of the wolf is the last one remaining."

This is an example of a "Gambler's ruin" problem. Issue is, during devouring the contents of the book, this class of problems proved to be
especially problematic to me. Even worse - the pdf with solutions didn't include the answer to this one.

So, I don't even have a concrete answer which would guide the reasoning process. 
If I could only get a rough estimate for the answer, by putting a ridicolous amount of work into this 3 line problem...

In fact, to make it even more fun (*starts sobbing*), let's solve a slightly more general problem: finding the probability in question
for all even number of point = N.
Here's the strategy:
    (1) write a function generating test cases for given N
    (2) for given N, generate M test cases, count number S of succesful cases
    (3) S/M will be an approximation of the probability in question for N by naive definition of probability
    (4) do this for all even N less than some MAX_N
    (5) plot the data, formulate a guess as to what type of a fairly straightforward function (ln x, 1/x, x^2, etc.)
        describes plot's shape the best
    (6) functions parameters are still unclear, as in the general shape may be described by ln x, but is it 2*ln(x)? Is it 5*ln(x) + 1023?
        Hence, fit the function to the data using regression
    (7) ???
    (8) profit

This file discusses step (1)
Writing a test generator proved to be trickier than I'm at liberty to admit. So tricky in fact that I had to enchance it with some visualization
for the sole purpose of debugging. I'm not proud of it. No one should.

Anyway, thing is pretty straightforward (post factum). Wolf starts at position 0. His current position is shown with a red circle.
An alive sheep is a white circle, an eaten one a black one.
If the wolf eats the opposite sheep (index N/2) last, the test is succesful, returning True. Otherwise, it is False.
Result of each case is logged in the terminal.

The simulation runs at a whopping 10 fps. It generates test cases indefinitely, so whenever You feel like You couldn't possibly
experience any more excitement, feel free to close the window. Or don't. 

Also, feel free to tweak to the N right below. I know it'll take You no time to break the whole thing.
Might as well just accept it.
