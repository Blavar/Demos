First of all, thanks for taking a look here. Given I have no formal education/courses/certificates in the field,
showcasing some things I've been working on through GitHub is my only shot at proving that I'm up to something.

Just a heads up: many of these programs are either unfinished, or left finished in a state
in which they'd probably rather be 'finished'. This is due to a short timespan in which most of them were done,
as well as a lateral way of tackling problems when I'm at liberty to do so.

Files are often decorated with verbose comments discussing a given problem, and my approach towards solving it,
as well as possible future improvements. I figured it might be a good idea to walk You through my problem-solving
process, while being fully aware of some of the comments verging on the side of triviality.

Anyway, thank You once again and enjoy. It might be... a trip.

One last thing. If I may. Even though as I mentioned, I have no formal training, 
courses, certificates, and so on, and so on *sniff*, I've been quite busy.
I've started a learning grind in May last year and been going strong ever since.
